          <div id="ep1">
            In 1991, Takaki Tōno quickly befriends Akari Shinohara after she
            transfers to his elementary school in Tokyo. They grow very close to
            each other due to similar interests and attitudes such as both
            preferring to stay inside during recess due to their seasonal
            allergies. Takaki and Akari begin to refer to each other using their
            given names without honorifics, which is an indicator of close
            friendship and intimacy in Japanese culture. Right after graduating
            from elementary school in 1994, Akari moves to the nearby prefecture
            of Tochigi due to her parents' jobs. The two keep in contact by
            writing letters but eventually begin to drift apart. When Takaki
            learns that his family will be moving to Kagoshima on the other side
            of the country the following year in 1995, he decides to personally
            go see Akari one last time since they will be too far apart to see
            and visit each other once he moves. He also writes a letter for
            Akari to confess his feelings for her. However, Takaki loses the
            letter during the journey and a severe snowstorm delays his train
            for several hours. When the two finally meet late that night and
            share their first kiss, Takaki realizes they will never be together.
            They find a shed to spend the night in due to the severe snowstorm
            and fall asleep after talking late into the night. Takaki departs
            from the train station the next morning and the two promise to
            continue writing to each other. As the train rolls away, Takaki
            decides that the loss of his letter is not important anymore after
            the kiss while Akari silently looks at her own letter addressed to
            Takaki which she decided not to give him.

            In 1999, Takaki is now in the third year of senior high in
            Tanegashima, where the Tanegashima Space Center is located. Kanae
            Sumida, a classmate of Takaki, has loved him ever since first
            meeting him in middle school but has never had the courage to
            confess her feelings to him. She tries to spend time with him,
            waiting long after school for the chance to travel home together.
            However, Takaki appears ignorant of Kanae's feelings and only treats
            her as a good friend. Kanae observes that Takaki is always writing
            emails to someone and staring off into the distance as if searching
            for something far away. It is later shown that Takaki's emails are
            not being sent to anyone, and he, in fact, deletes them after he
            finishes writing them. He also has recurring dreams which feature
            Akari. After a failed attempt to tell Takaki she loves him, Kanae
            realizes he is looking for something far beyond what she can offer
            and decides not to say anything, though she believes she will always
            love him. With such thoughts, she cries herself to sleep.

            It is now 2008 and Takaki is a programmer in Tokyo. Meanwhile, Akari
            is preparing to marry another man. Takaki still longs for Akari to
            the detriment of his lifestyle. He receives a call from his current
            girlfriend but does not answer which signifies the end of the
            relationship. Depressed, Takaki quits his job as he is unable to
            cope with his feelings for Akari. Akari goes through a box of her
            old possessions and finds the letter she had written for Takaki
            thirteen years ago in 1995. Takaki finds himself in a convenience
            store reading a magazine about the decade long journey of the rocket
            launched in the 2nd act. Takaki and Akari begin a dual narration
            where they both recall a recent dream. In the dream they relive
            their last meeting in the snow-filled Iwafune and remember the wish
            to someday watch the cherry blossoms together again. Later, while
            walking down the same road they knew when they were children, Takaki
            and Akari appear to pass and recognize each other at the train
            crossing. It is the same place they had promised to watch the cherry
            blossoms together thirteen years ago, just before Akari moved to
            Tochigi. On opposite sides of the tracks, they stop and begin to
            look back, but a passing train cuts off their view. Takaki waits for
            the train to pass and finds that Akari is gone. After a moment, he
            smiles to himself and continues walking as the cherry blossoms stir
            in the train's wake.

        <h2>Production</h2>
        <div class="production">
          Makoto Shinkai has expressed that, unlike his past works, there would
          be no fantasy or science fiction elements in this film. Instead, the
          feature film would attempt to present the real world from a different
          perspective. Shinkai's film gives a realistic view of the struggles
          many people have to face: time, space, people, and love. The title 5
          Centimeters per Second comes from the speed at which cherry blossom
          petals fall, with petals being a metaphorical representation of
          humans, reminiscent of the slowness of life and how people often start
          together but slowly drift into their separate ways. The movie marks
          the first time Shinkai has worked closely with a full staff of
          animators and artists.
